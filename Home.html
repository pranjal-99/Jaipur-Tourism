          <p>Jaipur is the capital of Rajasthan which was founded by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II on November 18, 1727. Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II was a Kachwaha Rajput who ruled Jaipur from 1699-1743. Prior to Jaipur, his capital was Amber which is 11 km away from Jaipur. With the increase of population, the king felt the need to shift the capital city. Another reason to shift the capital was the scarcity of water in Amber region.Jaipur is believed to be the first planned city of India and also that the king took a lot of interest in designing this city of victory. Several books on architecture and several architects were consulted before preparing the layout of Jaipur city.Jai Singh was concerned about the security of the cityand hence, he utilised his scientific and cultural interests to build it.</p>

          <h3 class="feature-title">Jai Singh</h3>
          <p>Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, the ruler of Amber Kingdom, was born in Amber. Amber then was the capital city of the Kachwaha Rajputs. His father, Maharaja Bishan Singh expired on December 31, 1699 and Jai Singh became the king at the age of 11. Jai Singh had a great interest in Mathematics, Architecture and Astronomy. He was given the title of Saramad-I-Rajah-I-Hind by Muhammad Shah on April 21, 1721. On June 2, 1723, Shah gave him the titles of Raj Rajeshvar, Shri Rajadhiraj and Maharaja Sawai (Sawai means One and quarter times more superior). Jai Singh’s descendants still use these titles along with their names.</p>

          <h3 class="feature-title">Hawa Mahal</h3>
          <p>The structure was built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, the grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, who was the founder of Jaipur.He was so inspired by the unique structure of Khetri Mahal that he built this grand and historical palace. It was designed by Lal Chand Ustad. Its unique five floors exterior is akin to the honeycomb of a beehive with its 953 small windows called Jharokhas decorated with intricate latticework.The original intent of the lattice design was to allow royal ladies to observe everyday life and festivals celebrated in the street below without being seen, since they had to obey the strict rules of "purdah", which forbade them from appearing in public without face coverings. This architectural feature also allowed cool air from the Venturi effect to pass through, thus making the whole area more pleasant during the high temperatures in summer.</p>
